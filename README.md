Expense Splitter App (Python CLI)

🚀 Project Overview
This is my very first Python project — a Command Line Interface (CLI) based Expense Splitter App. It allows users to split total expenses equally among multiple people. The app calculates how much each person should pay, tracks how much each participant has actually paid, and identifies who should pay more or who should receive money back. It also provides an interactive menu to add, delete, or update participant expenses.

🎯 Features
- Ask total group expense and split it equally among participants.
- Track individual participant names and their paid amounts.
- Calculate who should pay and who should get a refund.
- Menu options to add, delete, or update participant expenses.
- Input validation for safe and accurate entries.
- Simple terminal-based interface for smooth user interaction.
- Built using **core Python only (up to classes and objects).**
